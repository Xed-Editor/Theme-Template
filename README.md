# Theme Template

A theme template for **Xed-Editor**

Download the `theme.json` file, then add it to Xed-Editor via:
**Xed-Editor → Settings → Themes → Add Themes**

---

# Notes

1. You can remove any field from the `theme.json` file except **id** and **name**, and it will still work. If a field is missing, the default theme’s value will be used as a fallback.
2. In **editorColors**, some fields may not support transparency correctly, I’m not entirely sure, though.
